# Anonymity-and-Cognitive-Bias-Perception-of-Social-Media

## Objective
Exploring how **anonymity** and **cognitive bias** impact the perception of social media rumor posts amid **infodemic**.  Although it utilizes a study group of less than thirty, it targets interest demographics (college students, youth, avid social media users).  Three groups are surveyed to determine the **subliminal** effect online anonymity and messenger effect have on the perception of online social media posts.

### Significance
**Misinformation** (classified as fictious, false, or inaccurate information) and **disinformation** (misinformation shared deliberately to deceive and manipulate) has intense consequences on society.  With anonymity so easily accessible to any individual, as well as a global audience and platform, it is easy for someone to become a **misinfluencer** and contribute to infodemics, either intentionally or inadvertently.	Youths and those active on social media have been found to be more susceptible to misinformation.
